  abstract = {Similar to nearshore systems in temperate latitudes, the nursery paradigm for tropical back-reef systems is that they provide a habitat for juveniles of species that subsequently make ontogenetic shifts to adult populations on coral reefs (we refer to this as the nursery function of back-reef systems). Nevertheless, we lack a full understanding of the importance of the nursery function of back-reef systems to the maintenance of coral reef fishes and invertebrate populations; the few studies that have examined the nursery function of multiple habitats indicate that the relationship between juvenile production in back-reef habitats and their subsequent contribution to adult populations on reefs remain poorly understood. In this synopsis we (1) synthesize current knowledge of life history, ecological and habitat influences on juvenile distribution patterns and nursery function within back-reef systems; (2) outline a research strategy for assessing the nursery function of various habitat types in back-reef systems; and (3) discuss management recommendations, particularly in regard to how improved knowledge of the nursery function of back-reef systems can be used in fisheries and ecosystem management, including habitat conservation and restoration decisions. The research strategy builds on research recommendations for assessing the nursery function of temperate habitats and includes 4 levels of research: (1) building conceptual models to guide research and management; (2) identifying juvenile habitat use patterns; (3) measuring connectivity of juvenile and adult populations between habitats; and (4) examining ecological processes that may influence patterns assessed in Level 2 and Level 3 research. Research and modeling output from Levels 1 to 4 will provide an improved ecological understanding of the degree and importance of interconnections between coral reef and adjacent back-reef systems, and will provide information to managers that will facilitate wise decisions pertaining to habitat conservation, habitat restoration, and ecosystembased management, and the maintenance of sustainable fisheries.},

The concentrations of nine heavy metals and the total organic carbon content in sediment samples were determined for between Summer 2015 and Spring 2016. The mean contents of heavy metals were in decreasing order Fe\,{$>$}\,Mn\,{$>$}\,Ni\,{$>$}\,Cr\,{$>$}\,Zn\,{$>$}\,Cu\,{$>$}\,Co\,{$>$}\,Pb\,{$>$}\,Cd. Sediment quality guidelines indicate that Cr, Cu, and Ni pose a considerable threat to the aquatic ecosystem in Lake Bafa. Site L3 was found to be contaminated with Cd, Cr, and Ni, and the pollution load indices suggest that these metals had anthropogenic sources. The sediment samples were notably enriched with Cd and Ni. There is no consistent trend for seasonal effect in terms of the sample locations. However, at all sampling points, an increase in heavy metal concentrations was observed in the autumn. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that the sources of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn were all natural, the sources of Cd were anthropogenic, and the sources of Ni and Cr were both anthropogenic and natural. These results highlight that Cd, Cr, and particularly Ni represent the most serious threat in terms of heavy metal pollution in the ecosystem of the lake.},

  abstract = {Heavy metals are well-known environmental pollutants due to their toxicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulative nature. Their natural sources include weathering of metal-bearing rocks and volcanic eruptions, while anthropogenic sources include mining and various industrial and agricultural activities. Mining and industrial processing for extraction of mineral resources and their subsequent applications for industrial, agricultural, and economic development has led to an increase in the mobilization of these elements in the environment and disturbance of their biogeochemical cycles. Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with toxic heavy metals is an environmental problem of public health concern. Being persistent pollutants, heavy metals accumulate in the environment and consequently contaminate the food chains. Accumulation of potentially toxic heavy metals in biota causes a potential health threat to their consumers including humans. This article comprehensively reviews the different aspects of heavy metals as hazardous materials with special focus on their environmental persistence, toxicity for living organisms, and bioaccumulative potential. The bioaccumulation of these elements and its implications for human health are discussed with a special coverage on fish, rice, and tobacco. The article will serve as a valuable educational resource for both undergraduate and graduate students and for researchers in environmental sciences. Environmentally relevant most hazardous heavy metals and metalloids include Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As. The trophic transfer of these elements in aquatic and terrestrial food chains/webs has important implications for wildlife and human health. It is very important to assess and monitor the concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals and metalloids in different environmental segments and in the resident biota. A comprehensive study of the environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology of hazardous heavy metals and metalloids shows that steps should be taken to minimize the impact of these elements on human health and the environment.},

  abstract = {The effects of body size and age class on mercury concentrations were examined in the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, an ecologically important prey species in the Antarctic marine food web. Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate variation in mercury concentrations related to ontogenetic changes in diet and/or foraging habitat. Specimens of P. antarcticum were collected along the Ross Sea shelf in February 2008 and mercury concentrations in homogenized whole fish and muscle tissue were analyzed relative to standard length, age class (juvenile vs. adult) and isotopic measures of diet ({$\delta$}15N) and foraging habitat ({$\delta$}13C). While mercury concentration in muscle tended to be higher than whole-fish values, concentrations in these 2 matrices were highly correlated. A positive relationship was found between standard length and mercury concentration; further, adult P. antarcticum had significantly higher mercury concentrations than juveniles. Adult mercury concentrations were also more variable: the coefficient of variation in adult muscle (58.3\%) was more than twice that found in juveniles (25.0\%). Though no linear relationships were detected between standard length and {$\delta$}15N or {$\delta$}13C values when all individuals were combined, juvenile and adult size classes of fish differed in their isotopic niche position and width. In addition, {$\delta$}13C values explained the greatest amount of variation in wholefish mercury across all age classes and for adult fish alone. By expanding both the horizontal and vertical components of their foraging habitat, adult P. antarcticum may have a wider range of exposure to mercury compared with juvenile fish.},

Also considered is the importance of bacterial Fe liberation in regulating pore-water chemistry.  Two contrasting marine environments are included; one is the relatively Fe-poor FOAM site and the other is the Fe-rich sediments of the subaqueous Mississippi Delta.  Results show that oxide minerals are the most important Fe phases in early diagenetic pyrite formation.  However, viewed separately, lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite are more reactive towards sulfide than goethite and hematite.  When Fe oxides are present in relatively high concentrations, dissolved sulfide is nearly absent from sediment pore waters (with concomitant high concentrations of dissolved Fe), even in the presence of active sulfide production by sulfate reduction.  A combination of experimental results and diagenetic modelling shows that in some sediments pore water Fe finds it origin in the bacterial reduction of iron oxides.  This seems the case even though greater amounts of Fe are reduced by reaction of sulfide with iron oxides.  It appears that distinct microenvironments may exist in marine sediments, where, in one microenvironment, sulfide reacts with Fe oxides locally precipitating Fe sulfide minerals.  In another, Fe reduced and solubilized by microorganisms migrates freely into solution.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity at multiple levels \textemdash{} genotypes within species, species within functional groups, habitats within a landscape \textemdash{} enhances productivity, resource use, and stability of seagrass ecosystems. Several themes emerge from a review of the mostly indirect evidence and the few experiments that explicitly manipulated diversity in seagrass systems. First, because many seagrass communities are dominated by 1 or a few plant species, genetic and phenotypic diversity within such foundation species has important influences on ecosystem productivity and stability. Second, in seagrass beds and many other aquatic systems, consumer control is strong, extinction is biased toward large body size and high trophic levels, and thus human impacts are often mediated by interactions of changing `vertical diversity' (food chain length) with changing `horizontal diversity' (heterogeneity within trophic levels). Third, the openness of marine systems means that ecosystem structure and processes often depend on interactions among habitats within a landscape (landscape diversity). There is clear evidence from seagrass systems that advection of resources and active movement of consumers among adjacent habitats influence nutrient fluxes, trophic transfer, fishery production, and species diversity. Future investigations of biodiversity effects on processes within seagrass and other aquatic ecosystems would benefit from broadening the concept of biodiversity to encompass the hierarchy of genetic through landscape diversity, focusing on links between diversity and trophic interactions, and on links between regional diversity, local diversity, and ecosystem processes. Maintaining biodiversity and biocomplexity of seagrass and other coastal ecosystems has important conservation and management implications.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of published papers concerning seagrass meadows contain statements to the effect that seagrass beds serve as important nurseries for many species. We reviewed more than 200 papers that were relevant to the nursery role hypothesis. We used both vote counting and meta-analytic techniques to evaluate whether the body of previous studies that report seagrass meadows to be nursery grounds actually contain data that support this proposition. We restricted our analyses to papers that compared seagrass beds to other habitats, and examined data on a variety of well-studied species concerning their density, growth, survival and migration to adult habitat. Within this group of papers, we considered potential factors that could influence the nursery function (e.g. location, or laboratory vs field studies). We also evaluated case histories of well-documented largescale seagrass losses on the nursery function. Major results were consistent with the expectations that abundance, growth and survival were greater in seagrass than in unstructured habitats. Abundance data also suggested that seagrass beds in the Northern Hemisphere might be more important as nursery areas than those in the Southern Hemisphere. Surprisingly, few significant differences existed in abundance, growth or survival when seagrass meadows were compared to other structured habitats, such as oyster or cobble reefs, or macroalgal beds. Nor were there decreases in harvests of commercially important species that could clearly be attributed to significant seagrass declines in 3 wellstudied areas. However, there were decreased abundances of juveniles of commercially important species in these areas, suggesting a strong link between seagrass abundance and those of juvenile finfish and shellfish. One important implication of these results is that structure per se, rather than the type of structure, appears to be an important determinant of nursery value. Clearly, more rigorous studies that test all aspects of the nursery role hypothesis are clearly needed for seagrass meadows as well as other structured habitats. The results of such studies will allow better decisions to be made concerning the conservation and restoration of marine habitats.},

Experimental conditions have varied considerably in seagrass contaminant research and interspecific differences in chemical residues and chemical tolerances are common, which limits generalizations and extrapolations among species and chemicals. The few reported risk assessments have been usually local and limited to a few single chemicals and species representative of the south Australian and Mediterranean floras. Media-specific information describing exposure concentrations, toxic effect levels, and critical body burdens of common near-shore contaminants is needed for most species to support integrated risk assessments at multiple geographical scales and to evaluate the ability of numerical effects-based criteria to protect these marine angiosperms at risk.},

  abstract = {Mo\'in, on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, is a multi-use coastal zone with a variety of human activities that can cause metal pollution. With the purpose of assessing the current environmental burden due to heavy metal presence in the marine environment of Mo\'in, and their bioaccumulation in organisms of the nearby coral reef, we determined seven metals in samples of bottom sediments, macroalgae (Cryptonemia crenulata) and sponge (Cinachyrella kuekenthali). The results were compared with samples from the southern Caribbean, an area with little human activity. Using ICP-MS, results showed a concentration range for sediments Mn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Zn {$>$} Cr {$>$} Ni {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cd, algae Mn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Zn {$>$} Ni {$>$} Cr {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cd and sponge Mn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Zn {$>$} Ni {$>$} Cr {$>$} Cd {$>$} Pb, relatively low concentrations overall and no differences observed between sites. Bioconcentration factor {$>$} 1 was deter\- mined for Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, while concentrations in sediments were below the SQG thresholds. Our study provides the first data on metal concentrations in a macroalgae and a sponge from the Costa Rican Caribbean.},

Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their `resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.},

Watershed streams and ground water carry a variety of chemicals from agricultural, industrial, and domestic activities, while winds and currents transport pollutants from atmospheric and oceanic sources to these coastal ecosystems. The implications of the limited information available on impacts of chemical stressors on mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs are discussed in the context of ecosystem management and ecological risk assessment. Three classes of pollutants have received attention: heavy metals, petroleum, and synthetic organics such as herbicides and pesticides. Heavy metals have been detected in all three ecosystems, causing physiological stress, reduced reproductive success, and outright mortality in associated invertebrates and fishes. Oil spills have been responsible for the destruction of entire coastal shallow-water communities, with recovery requiring years. Herbicides are particularly detrimental to mangroves and seagrasses and adversely affect the animal\textendash algal symbioses in corals. Pesticides interfere with chemical cues responsible for key biological processes, including reproduction and recruitment of a variety of organisms. Information is lacking with regard to long-term recovery, indicator species, and biomarkers for tropical communities. Critical areas that are beginning to be addressed include the development of appropriate benchmarks for risk assessment, baseline monitoring criteria, and effective management strategies to protect tropical marine ecosystems in the face of mounting anthropogenic disturbance.},

Currently used pesticides: atrazine, metolachlor, and diazinon and legacy pesticide dieldrin were targeted. Pesticides were extracted using solid-phase extraction (SPE) of water samples, titanium plate passive samplers coated in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and eastern oysters (Crassostrea viginica) as biosamplers. A laboratory study assessed the extraction efficiencies and precision of each method. Passive samplers yielded the highest precision of the three methods (RSD: 3e14\% EVA plates; 19e60\% oysters; and 25e56\% water samples). Equilibrium partition coefficients were derived. A significant relationship was found between the concentration in oyster tissue and the ambient aquatic concentration.

  abstract = {Daya Bay, especially in the northwestern region, which is a nature reserve with larval economic fish and shrimp populations, is no longer an unpolluted marine environment due to the recent increases in anthropogenic activities. This study collected seasonal surface sediment samples from 20 sites in northwestern Daya Bay to evaluate pollution and ecological risks and to identify possible sources and transport pathways of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Hg, As). The results showed that all the heavy metal concentrations were below the established primary standard criteria, except for concentrations of Cr in spring, as well as Cu and Zn in autumn at several sampling stations, which had excess rates of 35, 4.76, and 4.76\%, respectively. The geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values of heavy metals indicated that all sites had unpolluted to moderate pollution levels. In comparison to the samples collected in autumn, those in spring experienced a higher degree of pollution, particularly Cr and As. The ecological risk indices of heavy metals in sediments ranged from 225.86 to 734.20 in spring and from 196.69 to 567.52 in autumn, suggesting that most sites had a moderate ecological risk or a considerable ecological risk, and very few a had high ecological risk. Moreover, ArcGIS10.2 software was used to visualize their spatial distribution, and the results were similar in both spring and autumn. The results of the Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that Cu, Hg, and Pb might be affected by anthropogenic activities, and As might be derived from natural sources such as atmospheric inputs. A cluster analysis showed that heavy metals were mainly affected by the negative impacts of human beings on the environment.},

There is significant local concern about potential negative impacts of pollution from these and other activities on fisheries stocks, as well as seafood as a vector for toxic contaminants to enter the human food supply. In this study, queen conch (Strombus gigas) tissues were analyzed for a suite of contaminants: metals, the pesticide DDT (and its degradation products), and energetic compounds (associated with munitions) from three areas around the island. The magnitude of contamination found in queen conch was within the range of values reported in other studies in the Caribbean, suggesting that the levels of these selected contaminants present in conch in Vieques are not unusual for the region.},

Less studied is how seascape context may affect other aspects of habitat quality including growth, condition, or production of focal species. Juvenile white grunts Haemulon plumierii are known to rest on patch reefs during the day and move into seagrass habitat at night to feed, linking multiple habitats through these daily foraging migrations. We created artificial reefs across a gradient of seagrass cover and determined how juvenile white grunt condition, growth, abundance, and secondary production were related to seagrass cover within the seascape. White grunt abundance was positively correlated with the cover of seagrass within the seascape, while condition (relative condition factor, Kn) and growth rate (measured using the ratio of RNA to DNA) did not vary among reefs within different seascapes. Secondary production of white grunts was found to be highest on reefs in seascapes with more seagrass. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased food resources associated with higher seagrass cover contribute to increased grunt production. Differences in habitat quality among reefs in different seascapes were manifest at the population (abundance) and ecosystem function (secondary production) levels and not at the individual level (individual growth rate or condition factor). These results highlight the importance of considering multiple levels of individual and population responses in assessments of habitat quality, and add evidence that seascape composition should be considered in spatially explicit management strategies.},

However, the effect of aquaculture activities on sediment Fe levels is not well studied. Fe levels and grain sizes are determined in two cores (respectively Core C in the culture area and Core A in the control area) in Sishili Bay to reveal the influence of cultivation on sediment Fe levels over an extended period. The sediment Fe levels are distinguished in the upper sections (culture period) but equal in the lower sections (non-culture period) of the two cores. The core C has the same Fe levels as Core A before 1950s (non-culture period). However, the sediment Fe levels of Core C increased during 1950s\textendash 1970s (the algae culture period) and decreased after the 1970s (shellfish culture period) compared with Core A, indicating the algae and shellfish culture impose opposite effects on sediment Fe levels. Similarly, sediment grain sizes are observed to be finer during the algae culture period but coarser during the shellfish culture period, and the variation of sediment grain sizes because of culture activities is the important factor affecting sediment Fe levels. The slowing down of ocean current due to algae culture causes finer particles and higher Fe levels in sediment. However, during the shellfish culture period, bio-deposition and re-suspension play major roles in coarsening sediment particles and decreasing sediment Fe levels.},
